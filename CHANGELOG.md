## [2.0.2] 2015-06-01

## [2.0.0] 2015-06-01

### Changed
- Upgraded stepped easing algorithm.
- `Action.hasChanged` set to `true` when `Action.isActive(true)`

### Removed
- `.props()` method removed - properties now saved directly to Action object.
- `.data()` functionality removed, just set properties of Action instead.
- `.flip()` is now `.flipValues()`.

## [1.4.1] 2015-05-31

### Fixed
- ActionGroup.stagger() wasn't returning `this`

## [1.4.0] 2015-05-31

### Added
- Action Groups for controlling multiple Actions at once.
- Stagger method for Action Groups.

- Added check for Process timers before clearing as clearTimeout is costing ~.4ms.
