### Flexible
* **Native DOM support:** CSS, SVG, SVG path and DOM attribute support, out of the box.
* **Unlimited:** Custom callbacks allow you output to any numerical property or API.
* **Power anything:** Use with React, Canvas, Three.js, WebSockets, etc.
* **Seamless interaction:** Tracks velocity for hand-off between input, animation and physics.
* **Node support:** Run on any Node environment to fuel the IoT.
* **Open rAF loop:** Run any Process on the core requestAnimationFrame loop.

### Extendable
#### Develop your own:
* **Easing:** Easing functions and bezier curves.
* **Physics:** Add new physics simulation methods.
* **Input:** Create custom Input interfaces for Oculus/Leap/anything.
* **Roles:** Extend our CSS/SVG/Attr support with routes for Canvas, Three.js, Google Map Symbols or any standardised numerical property.

### Performant
* Uses and exposes a single requestAnimationFrame thread that automatically winds down when not in use.
* Never magically reads the DOM, leaving you in total control of performance.
* The same size as Velocity.js, **over 66% smaller** than GreenSock TweenMax.
